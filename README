This is a mirror of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=278

Follows is an adaption of sqlplus.vim written by Jamis Buck see http://vim.sourceforge.net/scripts/script.php?script_id=97
for the original. 

This script contains code required to execute SQL queries from withing VIM.  It uses sqsh (http://www.sqsh.org/) however it could trivially be adapted to use isql.  It is very ruff and ready but seems to offer required functionality.

Thanks to Jamis Buck for creating sqlplus.vim I am sure if you compair the code you will see how little I have had to do to get this code to work ;-) 

INSTRUCTIONS
============

Edit ~/.sqshrc and add the line \set semicolon_hack=1 

Save the code into a file and source from your .vimrc or use your favourate autoload system.

Edit the code to add the credentials for the databases you would like to connect to.

In highlight mode hit F8 to execute the hightlighed SQL.  It will cope with broken lines.

Hit F8 with no highlighted selection and VIM will prompt you for a database to connect to.
